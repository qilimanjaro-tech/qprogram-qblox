"""The header lines the suite writes into its ``.qp`` fixtures, and what the installed core does.

Both versions in a fixture header follow an installed library rather than the numbers a test was
written under: the core DSL's `FORMAT_VERSION` for ``#!QProgram``, and this package's own
version, truncated to ``major.minor`` the way the writer truncates it, for ``require qblox``. A
fixture therefore stays loadable across a release of either. The tests that are about the
version rules build their own ``require`` line from `VENDOR_MAJOR`. `needs_core_migrations` skips
what only holds once the core DSL this package resolves is 0.2 or newer.
